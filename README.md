Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project

Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of electric vehicle (EV) data. The aim is to uncover trends, insights, and patterns within the dataset to better understand the electric vehicle market and its evolution over time.

Technologies Used-

Python
Pandas
Plotly
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains information about electric vehicles, including their makes, models, production years, and geographic locations. This comprehensive dataset enables a detailed examination of trends in the electric vehicle industry.

Analysis-

The analysis conducted in this project involved:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate analysis was performed to explore individual features of the dataset, such as distributions of vehicle makes and production years.
Bivariate analysis helped in understanding the relationships between various features, such as the correlation between the number of vehicles and their respective makes.
Visualizations:

Created various visualizations using Plotly to illustrate findings. This includes:

Choropleth Map: Visualizing the number of EV vehicles based on geographic locations, highlighting regions with significant concentrations of electric vehicles.
Racing Bar Plot: An animated plot displaying the evolution of EV makes and their counts over the years, effectively showcasing trends in the electric vehicle market.
The insights derived from this analysis provide a clearer picture of the electric vehicle landscape and the changes it has undergone over the years.
